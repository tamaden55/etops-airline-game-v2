# ETOPS Flight Planner

A web-based flight planning simulator for twin-engine aircraft operating under ETOPS (Extended-range Twin-engine Operation Performance Standards) regulations.

## Features

- **Aircraft Selection**: Choose from 42 twin-engine aircraft with different ETOPS ratings
- **Route Planning**: Calculate optimal great circle routes between airports
- **ETOPS Compliance**: Verify route compliance with ETOPS regulations
- **Interactive Map**: Visualize routes and ETOPS areas on a world map
- **Alternate Airports**: Find suitable alternate airports along the route

## Quick Start

1. Start a local web server:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

3. Select an aircraft, enter departure/arrival airports (e.g., NRT, LAX), and calculate the route.

## Development Status

- âœ… Backend ETOPS calculation engine
- âœ… Aircraft and airport databases
- âœ… User interface and styling
- âœ… Basic route calculation
- ðŸ”„ Pacific route display optimization (in progress)

## Known Issues

- Pacific transoceanic routes may display incorrectly on the map (calculation is correct)
- See `journal.md` for detailed development notes
